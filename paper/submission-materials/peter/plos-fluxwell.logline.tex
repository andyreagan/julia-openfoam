The paper proposes and implements a ``Lexicocalorimeter'':
An online, real-time, tunable instrument for assessing public health based
on food- and activity-related phrases expressed in social media.
Using a geotagged Twitter database,
patterns of caloric input, output, and balance
are explored for the contiguous US,
showing how variations in the measure behave with
changes in phrase usage.
Lexicocalorimetric scores
are correlated with a diverse set of population-scale
measures directly linking health, well-being, and demographics
to the caloric content of online expression,
offering a new way to describe and understand the dynamics of myriad social conditions.
